# What I do in this project as QA Engineer?
- **Successfully developed mobile automation testing using scripting (previously only used Katalon Studio), resulting in a faster and more efficient testing process due to the lightweight nature of scripting compared to Katalon Studio.**
- Collaborate with development team to understand project requirement, (e.g., expected results, scope of the project, and time frame testing)
- Creating detailed test cases and test scenarios to ensure maximum coverage of functional & non-functional requirements.
- Executing manual test and automation to validate the functionality, usability, and performance of the TODOIST Apps (e.g., Functional Test, Regression Test, UAT, maintaining automated test script to improve efficiency)
